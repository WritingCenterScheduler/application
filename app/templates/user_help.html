        <p>
            This page is used to provide your administrator with the hours that you are available to work every week
            depending on your schedule. You have three options for each of the available time slots: Red(0), Yellow(1) and
            Green(2).
            <br><br>
            Green means that it is a preferred time for you to work and that, if possible, these are the
            times that you would want to work. The scheduling algorithm will attempt to place you in these times as
            often as possible. Yellow means that you can work at that time if needed. You may be scheduled for these
            times if you are needed at these times but the scheduling algorithm will attempt to place you in as many
            green slots as it can before resorting to placing you in yellow slots. However, it is fully possible
            that you may be placed in slots marked yellow if you are needed at those slots. Red means that you are
            unavailable to work at that times slot. You will not be placed into any work slots that are marked red.
            <br><br>
            While the scheduling algorithm attempts to give everyone their optimal schedule, it is impossible for
            everyone to get their top choices at every timeslot. The schedule that you are submitting is a request
            and there are no guarantees that you will get assigned shifts that match all of your preferred slots.

        </p>
        <p>
            The data on this page is saved automatically as you make changes. There is no need to submit the changes
            in any way. Simply alter the table by clicking on a cell. The time slots will rotate between red, yellow
            and green each time they are clicked. Change the table so that it matches your availability and the
            changes that you have made will be automatically saved.
