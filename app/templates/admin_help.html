            <h2 id='ManagingYourUsers'>Managing Your Users</h2>
        <p>
           Under the Admin tab you can manage the different users of the application. You can create a new user in
            the create new users in the create new users table. To create a new user must enter the users PID, their
            email, and their status as either a returning employee, new employee or an administrator. You MUST hit
            create in order for the user to be created for the application. Additionally, you may paste a CSV file in
            order to create a group of users at once. However, in order for this feature to work you must follow the
            provided format. For example, entering the following:  "John","Doe","720384009","jdoe@live.unc.edu","010"
            would create a employee user named John Doe.
        </p>
        <p>
            Under the users table, you can manage the users of the application. You can delete users, toggle
            employees between returning and new, and set which users you want to try scheduling (green users will be
            used for scheduling).
        </p>
        <p>
            Under the Schedules table, you can click the run scheduler to run the scheduler on the currently selected
            employees. The current master schedule is highlighted in green and can be toggled on the right column of
            the table. In addition, you can view any of the generated schedules by looking on the right.
