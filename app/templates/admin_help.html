            pages provided to you!</p>

        <p>

            Under the Admin tab you can manage the different users of the application and change which schdule is the
            currently displayed master schedule.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>ADDING A USER:</strong>
            You can create a new user in the create new users in the create new users table. To create a new user you
            must enter the users PID, their email, and their status as either a returning employee, new employee or
            an administrator. You MUST hit create in order for the user to be created for the application.
            Additionally, you may paste a CSV file in order to create a group of users at once. However, in order for
            this feature to work you must follow the provided format. For example, entering the following:
            "John","Doe","720384009","jdoe@live.unc.edu","010" would create a employee user named John Doe.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>MANAGING USERS:</strong>
            Under the users table, you can manage the users of the application. You can delete users via the trash
            can icon , toggle employees between returning and new via the person icon, select a new color for a
            person (the color that they will be displayed as when you are looking at the master schedule) via the
            diamond button and set which users you want to try scheduling via the radio button icon (green users will
            be used for scheduling).
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>GENERATING A NEW SCHEDULE: </strong>
            Under the Schedules table, you can click the run scheduler to run the scheduler on the currently selected

            The current master schedule is highlighted in green and can be toggled on and off in the right column of
            the table via the radio button icon. These schedules can be deleted via the trash can button. You may
            export any schedule to CSV via the button with spreadsheet icon.  In addition, you can view any of the
            generated schedules by clicking on their names in the left column. The nickname of a schedule may be
            altered when viewing the actual schedule in the schedule tab.

        <p>
            <strong>CREATING A NEW LOCATION:</strong>
            Under the creation tab. You can create a schedule by giving it a name, an opening and
            closing time and specifying whether or not you would like the location to be returning employees only or any
            employee type.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>EDITING A LOCATIONS:</strong>
            A locations information can be edited from the the right table. You can update any of the currently
            selected locations information and it will be updated upon submission. Note that both for schedule
            creation and for updating schedules you must submit the data/changes before moving on to another page if
            you want your changes to be saved.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>CREATING/UPDATING A LOCATIONS TIME SLOTS:</strong>
            The table view beneath the the data entry tables is used to display and edit information about different
            locations. A white entry (0) indicates that the location does not need any staff at that time. Light blue (1)
            is used to represent that one employee is needed for that time slot at the current selected location. Darker
            blue (2) indicates that two employees are needed at that location during that time slot. The current selected
            location will be highlighted in grey. You may change the currently selected location by clicking on the tab
            with the name of the location that you would like to select. The table beneath the tabs will automatically be
            changed to the current location upon its selection.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>DELETING A LOCATION:</strong>
            A location may be deleted by selecting the location that you want to delete from the tabs above the table
            then clicking the delete button below the table. This will open a prompt that will confirm that you do
            indeed want to delete the selected location before proceeding to delete the location.
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> Unlike the data entry tables above the location table, any changes pertaining to
            the time slot availability of a location does not need to be submitted but will be updated automatically
            as changes are made. For example, if you wanted to change the 8:00 timeslot from zero people to one
            person, this change does not need to be submited but if you wanted to create a new location or update the
            name of a location then those changes must be submitted before the changes are permentantly recorded.
        </p>

            user-friendly nickname to the schedule this can be done via the text box below the four letter name. You
            must submit this name before navigating away from the page. A students name placed in a certain time slot
            represents that the student is currently scheduled to work at
            that time.
        </p>
        <p>

            removed from the schedule at that time slot.
        </p>
        <p>

            dragging one of the employees names onto the schedule during the time slot that you would like to add the
            student. If you would like the employee to work more than thirty minutes during that time slot then you
            must add them, then click and drag the bottom of their assigned time to extend the amount of time that
            they are working in that time slot.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>MOVING AROUND EMPLOYEES:</strong>
            Employees can be moved around the schedule by clicking on the employees name on the schedule and dragging and

        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>FILTERING BY LOCATION:</strong>
            On the left hand side of the schedule, you will seee a drop down menu under the heading Locations. From
            here you can choose which locations master schedule you would like to display or if you would like to see
            all of the locations at once. Any changes that you make to an schedule must be submitted before the
            changes are saved.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>FILTERING BY EMPLOYEE:</strong>
            On the left hand side of the schedule, you will see a drop down menu under the heading Employees. This
            can be used to filter the individual employees and display only one employee on the schedule at time. You
            can switch between an individual student and all students.
        </p>
        <p>
            <Strong>CHANGING THE AMOUNT OF TIME DISPLAYED:</Strong>
            You can change the amount of time to be displayed either to list the entire week, to display the week as a
            calender or to display an individual day. This can be toggled by selecting different tabs in the top left
            corner of the calender.
        </p>
        <p>
            <Strong>SAVING AND OVERWRITING THE CURRENT SCHEDULE</Strong>
            You can save the changes that you have made to the current schedule by clicking the save button located
            in the lower left corner of the page. Note that none of your changes that you have made will be submitted
            unless you save your changes before leaving the page. Additionally, once you have saved you changes the
            original schedule will be overwritten and you cannot return the schedule to it's original state.
        </p>
        <p>
            <Strong>SAVING SCHEDULE TO A NEW SCHEDULE</Strong>
            You can save the edits that you have made into a new schedule by clicking the "Save New" button under the
            save new schedule section of the page in the lower left corner. Note that unlike the "Save" button this
            does not destroy the original copy of the schedule but rather saves it to a new schedule under a
            different name thus both the original and the altered schedules will still be available.
