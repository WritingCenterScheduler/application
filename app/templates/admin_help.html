        <p>

            Under the Admin tab you can manage the different users of the application. You can create a new user in
            the create new users in the create new users table. To create a new user must enter the users PID, their
            email, and their status as either a returning employee, new employee or an administrator. You MUST hit
            create in order for the user to be created for the application. Additionally, you may paste a CSV file in
            order to create a group of users at once. However, in order for this feature to work you must follow the
            provided format. For example, entering the following:  "John","Doe","720384009","jdoe@live.unc.edu","010"
            would create a employee user named John Doe.
        </p>
        <p>
            Under the users table, you can manage the users of the application. You can delete users, toggle
            employees between returning and new, and set which users you want to try scheduling (green users will be
            used for scheduling).
        </p>
        <p>
            Under the Schedules table, you can click the run scheduler to run the scheduler on the currently selected
            employees. The current master schedule is highlighted in green and can be toggled on the right column of
            the table. In addition, you can view any of the generated schedules by clicking on their names in the
            left column.

	<h2 id='ManageLocations'>Manage Locations</h2>
        <p>
            Under the creation tab. You can create a schedule by giving it a name, a unique numeric code, an opening and
            closing time and specifying whether or not you would like the location to be returning employees only or any
            employee type. Additionally locations can be edited from the the right table. You can update any of the
            currently selected locations information and it will be updated upon submission. Note that both for schedule
            creation and for updating schedules you must submit the data/changes before moving on to another page if you
            want your changes to be saved.
        </p>
        <p>
            The table view beneath the the data entry tables is used to display and edit information about different
            locations. A white entry (0) indicates that the location does not need any staff at that time. Light blue (1)
            is used to represent that one employee is needed for that time slot at the current selected location. Darker
            blue (2) indicates that two employees are needed at that location during that time slot. The current selected
            location will be highlighted in grey. You may change the currently selected location by clicking on the tab
            with the name of the location that you would like to select. The table beneath the tabs will automatically be
            changed to the current location upon its selection.
        </p>
        <p>
            A location may be deleted by selecting the location that you want to delete from the tabs above the table
            then clicking the delete button below the table. This will open a prompt that will confirm that you do
            indeed want to delete the selected location before proceeding to delete the location.
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> Unlike the data entry tables above the location table, any changes pertaining to
            the time slot availability of a location does not need to be submitted but will be updated automatically
            as changes are made. For example, if you wanted to change the 8:00 timeslot from zero people to one
            person, this change does not need to be submited but if you wanted to create a new location or update the
            name of a location then those changes must be submitted before the changes are permentantly recorded.
        </p>
