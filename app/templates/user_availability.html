            <li><p><span class = 'text-table-0'>Red (0)</span> is used to represent time slots during which you
    absolutely
    cannot work.</p></li>
            <li><p><span class = 'text-table-1'>Yellow (1)</span> is used to represent time slots during which you could
                work but are not preferred. </p></li>
            <li><p><span class = 'text-table-2'>Green (2)</span> is used to represent time slots during which you would
                prefer to work if possible.</p></li>

    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> 
    <ol>
    <li>
        Setting a time slot to Green does not guarantee that you are scheduled for that timeslot. The availability you provide is a request and will be met as often as possible but cannot be guaranteed.

    <li>
        Please ensure that you choose each and every slot below. Clicking on any of the colored boxes automatically reflects the change in the database so no further submission is required.
